## Project Overview
For this project, you will consider an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. You will flesh the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment.
This project will require you to both make design decisions about how to run an A/B Test and analyze the results. Both are important skills for drawing conclusions based on online experiments.

**After completing this project, you will be able to:**

- Select metrics to evaluate a proposed change
- Characterize and validate those metrics
- Plan an appropriate duration for your experiment based on the number of samples needed and the expected risk
- Sanity check the results to make sure everything went smoothly
- Draw a conclusion based on the results
- Recommend whether or not to launch the change

**Included in this repository**

- Project Instructions
- Report detailing my analysis of the A/B Test
