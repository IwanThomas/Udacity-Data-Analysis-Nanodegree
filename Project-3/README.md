In this project, I choose the map of London from https://www.openstreetmap.org and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. Finally, I uploaded the cleaned data to SQL for querying.

In this project I:
- parsed, audited and cleaned a large XML file
- wrote this file to CSV
- uploaded and queried the file in SQL
- made visualisations in Pandas to help understand the data

In this folder there is
- a .ipynb file showing the majority of the code used 
- multiple .py files used to load csvs into sql
- a report
