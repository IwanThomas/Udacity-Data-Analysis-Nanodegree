I chose the London area from https://www.openstreetmap.org and used data munging techniques to clean the OpenStreetMap data. I uploaded the cleaned data to SQL for querying.

Key skills learnt:
- parsed, audited and cleaned a large XML file
- wrote this file to CSV
- uploaded and queried the file in SQL
- made visualisations in Pandas to help understand the data

In this folder there is
- a .ipynb file showing the majority of the code used 
- multiple .py files used to load csvs into sql
- a report 
- a small sample of the XML Document parsed (the XML document I used for the project was 60 MB)
