In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to the ENRON dataset to build a person of interest classifier.

This folder contains:
  - a PDF report documenting my work
  - the scripts I used. The main ones I wrote were poi_id.py and functions_for_poi.py
  - the dataset and other tools used in the project
