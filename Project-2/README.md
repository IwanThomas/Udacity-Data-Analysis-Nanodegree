In this project, I analyzed the Titanic Shipwreck Dataset from the Kaggle Website using Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
The dataset contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. 

I looked at a few factors which made people more likely to survive the Shipwreck and through doing this I
- went through all the steps invloved in a typical data analysis project.
- learnt to use NumPy and Pandas
- used Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
